# Test Specification for `generate_soundex` Function

**Function Name**: `generate_soundex`

**Description**:  
This function converts a given word into its corresponding Soundex code based on a set of predefined rules (e.g., handling characters and their mapping to digits, padding, handling duplicates, etc.).

---

## Test Cases:

### 1. Test Case: Empty Word
- **Test Method**: `test_empty_word`
- **Input**: `""` (empty string)
- **Expected Output**: `""`
- **Description**:  
  This test ensures that an empty string as input results in an empty Soundex code output.

---

### 2. Test Case: Single Character Word
- **Test Method**: `test_single_character_word`
- **Input**: `"A"`
- **Expected Output**: `"A000"`
- **Description**:  
  This test verifies that a single character word is padded correctly to form a 4-character Soundex code, where the first character is retained and the rest are padded with `0`s.

---

### 3. Test Case: Word with No Mapped Characters
- **Test Method**: `test_word_with_no_mapped_characters`
- **Input**: `"Aeio"`
- **Expected Output**: `"A000"`
- **Description**:  
  This test checks whether the function correctly handles words that contain only characters not mapped to any Soundex digits (vowels in this case). The output should retain the first letter and be padded with `0`s.

---

### 4. Test Case: Word with Consecutive Duplicate Mapped Characters
- **Test Method**: `test_word_with_consecutive_duplicates`
- **Input**: `"PAAT"`
- **Expected Output**: `"P300"`
- **Description**:  
  This test ensures that consecutive characters that map to the same digit are collapsed into a single digit, following the Soundex rule. Here, 'A' and 'A' both map to `0`, but only one `0` should be kept.

---

### 5. Test Case: Word with All Characters Mapped to Digits
- **Test Method**: `test_word_with_all_mapped_characters`
- **Input**: `"ACM"`
- **Expected Output**: `"A250"`
- **Description**:  
  This test checks if the function correctly maps all characters in the word to their corresponding Soundex digits, with no padding required.

---

### 6. Test Case: Word with Padding Needed
- **Test Method**: `test_word_with_padding_needed`
- **Input**: `"Akash"`
- **Expected Output**: `"A220"`
- **Description**:  
  This test ensures that if the Soundex code is shorter than 4 characters after applying the mapping, the result is padded with zeros until it becomes 4 characters long.

---

### 7. Test Case: Word with Exactly Four Characters
- **Test Method**: `test_word_with_exactly_four_characters`
- **Input**: `"Brock"`
- **Expected Output**: `"B620"`
- **Description**:  
  This test checks if the function correctly generates a Soundex code that is exactly 4 characters long, with no need for additional padding or truncation.

---

### Notes
- Each test method corresponds to a test case described in this specification.
- The expected output and conditions (input word and expected Soundex) are clearly defined for each test.
